# JobSityCodingChallenge
Mervin Flores iOS Development Coding Challenge to JobSity.

## Getting Started

This is a challenge to JobSity. Please read the app features to know how works the app

### Prerequisites

Clone repo and them run:

`` `
$ pod install
`` `

## App Features
* On the first time that you run the app you will encountered a mockup screen. My original idea was fill this main screen (named "All Shows") to show featured shows like "Most popular, Top rated ..." But TVMaze API dont provide me with this information so i was thinking about a Realm database with a prefetched information of these shows that I wanted to list. Similarly I leave it there for mockups evaluation criteria.

* In the same way i leave in place the actors section.

* In this two features you can look up to search icon, please tap on it to search a Show or an Actor in each screen.

## Actor Search
When you are searching for an actor result appears. You can click your favorite actor and get a detail information about it.

## Show Search
 When you are searching for a Show result appears. You can click on your wanted show and get to detailling information for it.
 
 ## Details on Shows
 In the "Details Show Screen" you can see the detailed information for a selected show, if you are scrolling down the screen you can see all the related episodes with the show. Please tap one episode to get detailed information about it.
 
 ## Thanks
 In hope that can i approve the criteria of the test. I needed some more time to deliver something better, but in this code you can take a quick look to my code arch and my way to develop.
